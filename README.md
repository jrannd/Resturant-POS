The problem: A soup shop is currently calculating customer total price at the cash register by hand.  The goal is to create a point of sale (POS) system the business can use to input customer orders,
membership status, and bulk discounts to correctly display the customer's total due. The POS uses while loops for the cashier to interact with and if statments to correctly total a customer's
order based on certian factors.
